## Main Features :bulb:

#### Browse News from a variety of curated categories
Simply choose a news topic from the sidebar to browse the latest articles.

#### Save important news for later
We don't always have time to read through the whole article. Double tap to add an article to your favourites and come back to it later.

#### Search at your fingertips
Can't find what you're looking for? Search for keywords to find articles for practically any topic.

## Api :newspaper:
NewsCast is powered by [Event Registry's](http://eventregistry.org/) api to search and provide relevant news articles.

## Getting Started :rocket:
Unfortunately, I can't afford to stay subscribed to Event Registry's API to keep this project running indefinitely. Don't worry though, you can sign up to obtain your own API key to run this project!

1. Sign up for an account on Event Registry. You can either use a [Free Trial](http://eventregistry.org/news_api) or subscribe to one of their [Monthly Plans](http://eventregistry.org/plans)
2. Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwoub3BRC6ARIsABGhnyYV0yPOYCiElQFHF-beeHsTu1yhqHWvNYrWBGz8hSg9RyjkidfYXQUaAhbqEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
3. Clone this repo
4. Open the project in Android Studio
5. Create a file called `gradle.properties` if it doesn't already exist in your root project directory
6. Add you API key for event registry into this file like this: `API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY`
You file should look something like this
``` gradle
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true
API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```
7. That's it! Sync and rebuild your project with Gradle and you're good to go!
